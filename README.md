<p>A data of water temperature level that affect fish behavior in Okinawa for 5 days on March 20-26, 2024.
  The conclusion from the data states the fish on March 23-24 most probably be lethargic since the normal water temperature in Okinawa is 21C; and fish could be lethargic and inactive in 
  above or below the normal temperature. A consistent control over the water temperature at midnight and daylight is recommended in days with no normal temperature.</p>
